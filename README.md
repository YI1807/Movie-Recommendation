# Movie-Recommendation
It helps the user to show the list of their favourite movies based on their given movie.  It creates personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modelling and heuristics with the data available.
